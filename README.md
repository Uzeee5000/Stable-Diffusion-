This is an implementation of DDPMs by Jonatahan Ho, J., Jain, A. and Abbeel, P., 2020. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models. Advances in neural information processing systems, 33, pp.6840-6851.
Dataset used in this Implementation was GAMA postage stamps available at https://www.gama-survey.org/ generated by professor Simon Driver.
This survey was conducted by the GAMA team utilizing the AAOmega multi-object spectrograph installed on the Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT). This GAMA dataset was generated by Prof. Simon Driver (UWA) using grZ bands for RGB, one of the main objectives of the GAMA is to study objects at 1 kpc to 1 Mpc (gama-survey 2023).
Replace all the directories in the code with the directories of your own local dataset.
